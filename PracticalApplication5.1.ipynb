    "### Will a Customer Accept the Coupon?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine driving through town and a coupon is delivered to your cell phone for a restaraunt near where you are driving. Would you accept that coupon and take a short detour to the restaraunt? Would you accept the coupon but use it on a sunbsequent trip? Would you ignore the coupon entirely? What if the coupon was for a bar instead of a restaraunt? What about a coffee house? Would you accept a bar coupon with a minor passenger in the car? What about if it was just you and your partner in the car? Would weather impact the rate of acceptance? What about the time of day?\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, proximity to the business is a factor on whether the coupon is delivered to the driver or not, but what are the factors that determine whether a driver accepts the coupon once it is delivered to them? How would you determine whether a driver is likely to accept a coupon?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "This data comes to us from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then ask the person whether he will accept the coupon if he is the driver. Answers that the user will drive there ‘right away’ or ‘later before the coupon expires’ are labeled as ‘Y = 1’ and answers ‘no, I do not want the coupon’ are labeled as ‘Y = 0’.  There are five different types of coupons -- less expensive restaurants (under \\\\$20), coffee houses, carry out & take away, bar, and more expensive restaurants (\\\\$20 - \\\\$50). "

    "Based on the data exploration of the Coffee House coupons, the following hypotheses can be derived regarding the characteristics of drivers who accepted the coupons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Temperature: Drivers are more likely to use the coffee house coupon as the temperature gets warmer.\n",
    "* Age: Younger drivers are more likely to accept the coffee house coupon compared to older drivers.\n",
    "* Coffee House Visit Frequency: As the frequency of visiting coffee houses increases, the acceptance rate of coffee house coupons also increases until it reaches a peak at around 3 visits per month and then slightly decreases.\n",
    "* Restaurant Visit Frequency: Drivers who visit restaurants more frequently, regardless of the price range, are more likely to accept the coffee house coupon.\n",
    "* Distance: The acceptance rate of the coffee house coupon decreases as the distance from the driver's location to the coffee house increases.\n",
    "* Carry Away: Drivers who frequently purchase take-away food are more likely to accept the coffee house coupon.\n",
    "* Other Variables: Some categorical variables such as destination, passenger type, weather, expiration, marital status show affect the acceptance rate of the coffee house coupon.\n",
    "* income, gender, presence of children, and same direction do not show consistent patterns or strong relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "These hypotheses provide insights into the characteristics of drivers who are more likely to accept Coffee House coupons. These insights can be utilized when deciding target demographic/environment to distribute the coupons.\n",
